        "content": "<h2>Balayage vs. Traditional Highlights</h2><p>Balayage is a freehand colouring technique where the stylist paints highlights onto the hair in a sweeping motion. The result is soft, sun-kissed gradations with less obvious regrowth lines.</p><p>Traditional (foil) highlights use foils to isolate hair sections and lift pigment in a controlled, repeatable pattern. This method gives a more uniform, higher-contrast look and can cover larger areas quickly.</p><h3>Key Differences</h3><ul><li><strong>Placement and Finish:</strong> Balayage gives a softer, blended result; traditional highlights provide more uniform streaks and higher contrast.</li><li><strong>Maintenance:</strong> Balayage often requires less frequent touch-ups; traditional highlights may need more regular maintenance.</li><li><strong>Customisation:</strong> Balayage excels at bespoke, face-framing looks; foil highlights are ideal for precise lightening.</li></ul><p>Both techniques benefit from professional toning and homecare to maintain colour and minimise brassiness. Book a consultation to see which method suits you.</p>",
